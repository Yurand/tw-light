This is the Sclore Frigate (to be renamed later.)
In designing it, I used something of a scorpion theme.


Fire - each point of energy fires two high speed, poorly
aimed, very short range shots.  This can knock out 
incoming weapons or gut a dreadnought at close range.


Special - Charges up a rear energy field.  This costs 8
energy.  This can act as a shield against incoming
weapon fire from the rear, and can strike the enemy
to cause damage.  The rear energy field can be charged
up to nine times.

Fire + Special:  launches the energy at the enemy.  This
is a very fast moving shot.
