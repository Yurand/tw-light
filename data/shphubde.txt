Hellenian-Uberrace Devestator.

Hellenian society was split after genetic manipulation, into an uberrace and the normal Hellenians. Instead of producing a happier and prosperous society, it became one of oppression and poverty of the masses, versus extreme wealth and power for the 'New Breed'. Their planet was rechristened "Perfection" by the New Breed, but it's far from perfect. They painted a big star on their ship, to reflect their high star-status.

The devastator is designed to get rid of anything that wants to come too close to the Uber-Captain, while also being effective at long range.

Main weapon: Space Distortion Gun (or SDG). Long range and highly dangerous (6d).
Special Weapon: mortar fire, creates small explosions around the ship at medium range (1d);it concentrates fire on 5 locations, related to the star pattern on the ship.
Quirk: Use of the main slows the ship down. Combine this with poor accel rate; fortunately there's the mortar fire which can create a protective ring around the ship.
