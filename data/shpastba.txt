Astromorph: Basilisk

A snake-like ship/creature

Primary: HELD: Activates a homing-helper laser.
	 RELEASED: Fires a poison blast;
		    Slight speed boost and aiming help if locked on.

Secondary: Hurtifies the coils, a combination shield/contact weapon.
	    Also, if holding left/right/forward, will flick the ship in that direction

Quirk:	* Coils are the health unit, each coil can absorb 1 point of damage before it is destroyed
	* When battery is full and no weapons fired, the ship will heal coils automatically at a slow rate
