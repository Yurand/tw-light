Xaaxees Arrowhead


main: release mines. The mines are released with a velocity close to that of the ship.

special: actives a shield on the mines. This makes them invulnerable, but takes a lot of energy.

Tactics: launch the mines, activate their shield, and hide behind them. Or, head for the enemy, release the mines so that they'll move at a decent speed towards the enemy, and run away.
