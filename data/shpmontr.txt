Mono Tron

Just for fun :-) Have you ever played with Trons?
Monos are from a totally another dimension where everything
is rectangular.

Primary Weapon:
  Shoots Mono Missiles that travel in four directions. They are homing if not
  shot in the opposite direction.

Special:
  Draws a wall of laser behind the ship. A segment of the wall disappears if
  either the ship dies or runs out of battery or the user releases the special
  fire button or it is hit or the segment next to it (in the direction of the
  ship) disappeared.

Notes:
  The ship goes in four directions (up, down, left and right). It has constant
  speed and pressing the left or right buttons makes it turn 90 degrees. The
  button has to be released before the ship can turn again (this makes it hard
  to control for bots).
