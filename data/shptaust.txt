Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This small, fast and highly maneuverable vessel is armed with two missile launchers,
each capable of firing up to three missiles before reloading. Missiles can be launched
in one of the two modes: fast and slow. In "fast" mode, missiles can be launched quicker
(higher rate of fire), have higher speed, higher acceleration, but much lower turning rate.
Not to mention that they burn fuel much faster, thus significantly decreasing effective range.
Generally, "slow" mode is very good for harassing enemy at long range, and "fast mode" -
for throwing 'em back out of the "comfort zone".

Quirk: the missiles do not detonate on contact. Instead, they pierce the target's armour
and "latch" onto the hull, applying all the thrust of their engine to accelerate and rotate
(depends on the moment of force) the enemy. The small warhead will detonate only when
all fuel has burned out.
