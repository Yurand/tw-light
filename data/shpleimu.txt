Lei Mule,

nicknamed like this for its ferocious backward attack...

Main weapon: fires shots forward/backward

Special: fires *dummy* shots forward/backward, called REAL: Realistic Enhanced Agressive Lightforms.

The shots block other weapons, so the REAL shots can also be used to take down incoming missiles, just like the real shots.
