The Pkunk Fury is one of the original ships
from Star Control 2.  They were allies in SC2.  

Their main weapon consists of a 3-way cannon 
that fires molten metal.  

Their special weapon is to insult the enemy.  
They must insult the enemy to recharge their 
batteries.  

An additional passive ability that they have 
is to resurrect themselves when they die.  This 
ability doesn't always work, but when it does 
work it can be extremely annoying.  Imagine 
shooting down the same enemy ship, over and 
over and over again.  

The Pkunk, as a race, are themed heavily along 
"new age" lines.  They're probably into to 
crystal power, herbal remedies, psychics, 
getting in touch with your inner child, etc.  
And their psychic stuff really works... maybe...

The Pkunk are a bird-race closely related to 
the Yehat, though they have very different 
personalities.
