Class		- Commercial cargo tug

Weapons:
 Primary 	- Weak short-range laser
 Secondary	- Decelerate, straightens out the chain
 Teritary	- fire + special, ditch the cargo

Weaknesses:	This is NOT a military vessel, and is not meant to
 enter combat.  It's single weapon is only really meant to crack
 asteroids.  Even worse, the structural integrity field used to
 chain the cargo containers behind it means that any damage on them is 
 transferred to the tug.  If forced to enter combat, the captain's
 only recourse is to ditch the cargo entirely and take refuge in the
 slowly growing cloud of containers.

Strengths:	No military strengths.

Quirks:		Although the tug itself has terrific acceleration, this
 is more than offset by the kilotons of cargo it tows.  If caught in a
 gravity well, the cargo can easily haul the whole mess into the planet
 unless the captain jettisons it immediately.
