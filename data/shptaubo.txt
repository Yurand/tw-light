*Tau* BOMBER V.4.0
------------------

1. Weapon:
~~~~~~~~~~

This vessel carries heavy bombs (d-uh) designed for planetary assaults,
but can also be used to inflict massive damage on quasi-stationary targets
such as orbital installations or heavy battleships. For the latter purpose,
each bomb has a proximity sensor, and will detonate when close an enemy target.

To prevent premature bomb detonations that may damage the ship itself,
the deployed bombs are inactive. Only a confirmation signal (sent when
the Bomber's pilot releases the bomb deploy button) will activate the warhead.

Extreme caution is recommended when attempting bombardment in zero-G environment.


2. Special:
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ship is equipped with a dual decoy launcher system. Decoys will mislead
or even temporarily jam practically any targeting system locked onto the Bomber.
This system is a very effective defense against homing weapons, but can also
be used to confuse enemy ships to let the Bomber pilot enough time to get away.
Unfortunately, decoys are relatively short-lived.
