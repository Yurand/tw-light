The Yehat Terminator is one of the original ships
from Star Control 1.  They were on the Alliance side.

Main is a dual, fast firing gun of intermediate range.

Special spawns a shield, needed because their home
system was located in a nebula and the shield was
used to reduce friction.

The Yehat are pterodactyl-like creatures.

In Star Control 2, the Yehat are proud warriors, but who
are under the ruling of a Queen whom they always respected,
but who chose the side of the dishonorable Ur-Quan. On top
of this, they suffer from great guilt about the great
sacrifice of the Shofixti, a race which they uplifted and
admired. They loathe the Pkunk, who are a peace-loving
offshoot of the Yehat race. In short, the Yehat are a very
unhappy race.
