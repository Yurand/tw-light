The Spathi Eluder is one of the original ships
from Star Control 1.  They were on the Alliance side.

Their role in sc1:

The main weapon is a short range, fast firing,
cannon. Only to be used in unfortunate close
encounters!

The special consists of BUTT missiles, backward
utilizing tracking torpedoes. Those are ideal for
those who are afraid to turn and face their enemies.
Very effective in combination with the high speed
of the Eluder.

The Spathi are insectoids.

In star control 2, the Spathi formed a cowardly
race, who were very funny ;)
