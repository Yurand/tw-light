ToggleMode = 1
;ToggleMode = 1 means that touching the special key causes a drive mode change.
;ToggleMode = 0 means that holding down the special key causes a drive mode change

;Only relevant for ToggleMode = 0
;IsInertialess = 1 means standard drive default, inertialess drive with special key depressed.
IsAutothrust = 1
;a value of one means that the inertialess form is always thrusting... no thrust key required.  A value of zero means that the thrust key works as normal in inertialess form.
