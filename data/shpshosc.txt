The Shofixti Scout is one of the original ships
from Star Control 1.  They were on the Alliance side.

They were uplifted by the Yehat and thus joined the
honorable side.

Main weapon fires a short range dart.

The special blows up your ship, the so-called Shofixty
blaze of Glory. This does considerable damage to
opponents in the neighbourhood.

The Shofixti are a feral species.

They were nearly extinct after blowing up the outer
layer of their sun to destroy an Ur-Quan fleet. The
player is able to find a few survivors, whom repopulate
the species - giving cheap crew.  (Shofixti breed VERY 
fast)
