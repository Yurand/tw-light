The Androsynth Guardian is one of the original ships
from Star Control 1.  They were on the Hierarchy side.  

The Androsynth Guardians main weapon fires acid
bubbles that slowly home in on enemies using the
Chaos(tm) tracking system.  

It's special weapon transforms it into a flaming comet,
which is extremely fast and maneuverable, and inflicts
damage upon impact.  


Androsynth are modified humans.  They have numbers in
their names, and are frequently clones, and are
heavily genetically modified.  They have a history of
being oppressed by the rest of humankind, and hate
humans as a result.  Androsynth seem to be much more
technologically advanced than normal humans.  

In Star Control 2, the Androsynth were apparently dead
before the game started ; their homeworld showed signs
of some horrific struggle, strongly reminiscent of the
writtings of science fiction / horror author Howard
Philips Lovecraft III.
The implication is that all Androsynch were killed (or
worse) by the Orz or some race related to the Orz.
