Zekfahan Shocker
----------------

The primary is the same but the graphics made it necessary
to put the guns closer. If you think this a major drawback,
I might redesign it to feature the original barrel distances.

The secondary now is a chain lightning weapon. It will bounce
towards every non-planet object after a hit, including the
shocker itself. It does a reducing amount of damage with
each bouncing, and the shocker is immune to its shot.

Thanks for Richardyzo for allowing me to rework his ship idea.
(I've done it because the original one had some copyright
issues with StarCraft.)

I'd like to thank "the coder" also for doing me this job.

Have fun with the new Shocker! Richardyzo, I hope you enjoy it!
