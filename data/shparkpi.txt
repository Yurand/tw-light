The Arkanoid Pincer is a close range ship, with potentially
devastating claws that can snap down and crunch the enemy ship.

fire = snaps the pincers forward.  This costs no energy.
Damage is 2 points if only one pincer hits.  Damage is 10
points (2 claw + 2 claw + 6 crush) if both pincer hit on
the same attack.

special = pressing and holding the special causes the ship
to enter scuttle mode.  Pressing special will bring the ship
to a dead stop.  The right and left thrust buttons now move
the ship left and right, as a crab scuttling sideways.

Using scuttle mode costs energy.

releasing the special button returns the ship to normal
maneuvering.
