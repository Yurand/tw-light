The lyrmristu war destroyer is a solid vessel, especially if it has time to
raise several force spheres before entering close combat.

fire = fires a spread of three energy bolts.  Cost is 3 battery.

special = creates a force sphere around the ship, which can
both inflict and absorb damage.  Each use of the special costs
8 power, and gives the shield 2 additional points of
damage/armour.  This force sphere does not have a time limit.
The sphere may accumulate a maximum of 16 points of potential
damage/protection.
