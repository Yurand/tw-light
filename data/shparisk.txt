The Arilou Skiff is one of the original ships from
Star Control 1.  They were on the Alliance side.  

The Arilou Skiffs main weapon is a short range
auto-aiming laser.  

It's special weapon is a short range hyperspace shunt
(random teleport).

Arilou ships are extremely maneuverable, and contain
advanced inertialess drives that stop the ship instantly
when it stops thrusting.  

Discrepancy: In SC1 & SC2, Arilou Skiffs always auto-aimed
straight towards their enemy if they had one, otherwise
straight.  In TimeWarp, where there can be multiple
enemies, it auto-aims at the closest enemy if one is close,
or fires straight forward otherwise.  

Arilou look like little classic aliens: little green men.  

In Star Control 2, the Arilou were mysterious and aloof
creatures that has been stalking humanity for centuries, 
and maybe have been involved in the origin of the human
race.  They expressed special dislike for the Orz.  They
and the Orz were the two races in SC2 that came from other
dimensions.
