Notes
 The turret is tricky to use, but fun once you're used to it.  It is 
 controlled in the standard Orz-like fashion, with some differences.
    First, it starts rotating slowly but rapidly accelerates to allow 
 for both accuracy and rapid movement.  Second, it can rotate  while firing,
 slowly and hyperaccurately.  Third, it is canted far off to one side.
 Lastly, it can't rotate a full 360 degrees, only an odd 240 degree arc.


Weaknesses
 Slow speed, bad turning, and a 'blind spot' where the turret can't aim.
 
Strengths
 Large firing arc, high accuracy, and long range.

Race:
 The Tridemin are radially symmetric rather than bilaterally symmetric; more
 like a starfish than a man.  This may explain their 360-degree perception
 and their odd ship design.
