TAU MERCURY

The ship is equipped with a spatial stabilizer, which dampens the velocity vector component perpendicular to the ship's main axis.  "Special" key (while held) disables this function.

Use the stabilizer to:

1.  Make turns without loosing forward momentum/speed (especially useful on high velocities).
2.  Slow down (hold "special", turn 90 degrees, release "special").

Please note that:

1.  Stabilizer also works when flying backwards.
2.  If your velocity vector is altered (by collision, gravity or something else), the stabilizer may slow you down (normal function).
3.  The "gravity whip" capability is reduced (yet not completely disabled) for this ship to make it more "ballanced".


INI settings for the stabilizer:

BankTime [ms] - regulates banking speed (the smaller the value, the faster the banking, the faster the ship achieves maximum turning rate).
RelaxTime [ms] - regulates how fast the ship will return to stable position (zero turning rate) after a turn button is released.
ExpAbs, LinAbs - exponential and linear damping, respectively (define how stabilizer works). It's better not to change them.
ThrustLimit - maximum "gravwhip" velocity gain. Value of 1.0 - no graviwhip;  2.0 - the TW default for most ships (although this ship will still accelerate slower gravity well).

TurnLag - set it to 1 to experience smooth turning, controlled by banking (cool); set it to 0 for "standard" control scheme, ignoring banking (easier to fly).
