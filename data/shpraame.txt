Ship: ????? Menacer
Class: Scary IDF Being (the ship itself is a being?)
Crew: 14 (gray, not green) (why i'm asking if the ship itself is a being 
	(which is the only way this is allowed))
Batt: 4 (slow-medium regen rate)
Top Speed: 64 (pkunk)
Acceleration: 16 (pkunk)
Turning: 1 (pkunk)
BattRegen: poor.

Primary Weapon:
	Vivisector-like grab (with a single fatox-like field) user controlled release.
        Damage_standard: algorythm description: crew_percent = (other->crew*100)/42 - crew;
						other->damage += crew_percent/10;
						crew += crew_percent/10;
		Layman's: Target's crew as a percentage (42 max) minus your own crew(flat) divide by 10,
			then add that damage back to your own crew.

		Example1: Ur-Quan with 42 crew, menacer with 8 crew.
			crew_percent = 92
			other->damage += 9
			crew += 9
		Example2: Shofixti with 6 crew, menacer with 10 crew.
			crew_percent = 4
			other->damage += 0
			crew += 0
		Example3: Yehat with 20 crew, menacer with 10 crew.
			crew_percent = 37
			other->damage += 4
			crew += 4

		so in other words, my algorythm works as per design specifications.

        Extra: inserts psy-poison (narool-like), decay reset constantly until ship detaches
        Damage_extra: 3 damage upon release (by hitting fire again)
        Drain: 0

special:
	Phase lock: locks current phase-shift.
	Drain: 1 batt/0.6 seconds

Extra: Phase shift (goes in and out of phase constantly) damage incurred is reduced by the percentage
	of phase.

Cosine wave could be used - but a standard saw wave would be equally practical in my opinion (a simple
integer variable oscilating between 0 and 100 to represent a percentage of phase (0 is all out and 100
being all in)

which brings me to my next question: how is phasing dealt with - IE: at what point does it no longer 
become tangable (10% in phase?, 20% in phase?) - have information now: 5% or 10%
