The Dajelkia Emissary is an unusual warship, in that it
creates its own lasting terrain for a tactical advantage.

fire = fires a single pulse blaster. 1 energy, 1 damage,
2 armour.  There are four pulse blasters on the ship.  
All four blasters are cycled through, one at a time.

special = this button has three separate functions,
depending upon the situation.
1) releases the Dajielka Sanctuary.  This appears
to be a rip in space-time, in the form of a miniature
'white hole'.  Over time, it grows in strength, as numerous
spinning tendrils emerge.  The tendrils do damage to other
ships and shots that may come near it.  The sanctuary itself
is difficult, but not impossible to destroy.

2) Redeploy Sanctuary.  If the special is held down for
five seconds while the ship is outside the sanctuary, it will
be redeployed in the current spot, and the old sanctuary 
destroyed.

3) Harvest.  If the ship is flying over one or more tendrils,
pushing and holding the special will cause the tendrils to be
harvested.  This destroys the tendril, and gives 1-9 energy,
depending on the strength of the tendril.  If the battery
is full, the ship can regenerate 1 crew for every 20 energy
that would have been created.

The Emissary has no dynamo.  However,
the Emissary may use the tendrils of the Sanctuary to recharge
itself and regenerate.  Each tendril that touches the emissary
gives the Emissary a small amount of energy.  To obtain energy
rapidly, it must use the special button to harvest the tendrils.
In effect, the sanctuary is something of a 'fortress'.  The
Emissaries own pulse blasters will interfere with the tendrils,
so the Emissary must emerge from the Sanctuary to do battle.

There may only be one Sanctuary in existence at a time.
Creation of a new sanctuary destroys the old one.

Upon the destruction of the ship, the Sanctuary is also
destroyed.
