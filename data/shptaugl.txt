"TAU" GLADIUS

This ship has long and somewhat sad history.  It was originally designed for the Team
for one of the new races, and went through numerous revisions.  While the weaponry
stayed more or less the same, all of the original "quirks" (and there were quite a few)
were eventually removed.  The visual characteristics of the ship also changed for the better,
although the latest version has no additional animations (such as the gun rotation), since
they would be practically unnoticeable at the current ship size.

A note on weapons: primary is just what it looks like; the secondary is a homing missile, but it
will loose its target if it went outside the tracking angle.

Credits: the old TW team (especially TGF) provided input and feedback on design;
Fusion made the prototype 3D model, which was used (after some re-working) for
the first version renderings; later on significant aesthetic improvements to the model
were made by Forevian. The rest of the work (design, modeling and re-modeling work,
textures, rendering, code, sfx, etc.) were done by yours truly.

And since in the last year or so there was no apparent interest on the part of the Team
in using this ship/design in the full game, I decided to publish a re-designed version for
the open melee (after changing the name and victory ditty, of course).  At least this way there
will be _some_ use for time and effort put into this ship.
