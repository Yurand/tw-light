Frein Schizm.

The Frein are highly advanced beings, possessing the powers of creation and destruction. They like to be in *control* of the outcome of the battle, and they often are.


Main weapon: fires missiles (1d).

Special: fires healing torpedoes (-1d). If enemy (target) crew is maxed, the recrewing process goes on on board of the Schizm (aint that fair...).
