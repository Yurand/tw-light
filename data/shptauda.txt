T-DAGGER

This is a small and fast ship armed with short-range powerful laser and
plasma pulse generators.  No quirks, just a fishbait... with a bite.  Basically,
the ship was designed to "fit" the existing 3D model, not the other way around.
I would not call it a "100% success", but... it is better than letting a decent
3D model go to waste, anyway.
