This is a slow, but potentially very dangerous cruiser.  The main gun fires
a spread of five high damage unguided torpedoes that are all but immune to
point defense systems.

fire = torpedo spread (5 x 2 point warheads) cost 10 power.  2 damage each, 
4 armour each

Changed by GeomanNL:

Special increases the spread of the 5 missiles.
Special in combination with fire decrease their spread.
As long as special is pressed, count-down is frozen, so they live longer.

Rear-fire torpedo removed, turn-rate increased.
