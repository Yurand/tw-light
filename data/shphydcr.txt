Hydrovar:

fire = intense forward firing beam weapon that
does minimal damage at the max range, and a
BUNCH of points of damage at  point blank range
if the beam stays on the target for the whole
firing period. Firing cost is 12.

special = Launch a single fighter forward.
Launch cost is 8 battery and 1 crew.  A maximum
of eight fighters may be in flight at once.

These are escort/superiority fighters.  They will
remain near the mother ship, and will attack any
targets that come near the ship, including mines,
enemy fighters, and incoming weapons fire.  If
they accidentally crash into the opposing ship, 
they will inflict 3 points of damage.  Also, they
remain on the board a while after the mother ship
is killed.  They are normally smart and agile
enough to bounce away from most asteroids, planets,
and ships.
