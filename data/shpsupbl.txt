The Supox Blade is one of the original ships
from Star Control 2.

The main weapon consists of a rapid-fire forward
cannon.

The special allows the ship to move almost instantly
left, right, back, like a leaf in the wind.

The Supox are the only sentient plant species known.

The Supox formed peaceful allies of the Utwig, whom
they helped in their time of distress.
