Alary Battlecruiser (v.2.3)
===========================

Weapon:
-------
Heavy "fire and forget" MIRV torpedo. The torpedo is extremely slow though
(even warheads have lower-than-average velocity).

Note: Torpedo itself will not do damage on collisions (only launched warheads will). 

Turrets:
--------
Press "special" to turn them on or off (look in the upper-right corner
of the "captain screen" to see current state). When on, turrets will
automatically shoot on possible targets in range. Priority list is
(descending): your target, any enemy ship, non-damaging things,
heavy shots.

Note: Turrets can be damaged (disabled).

Engines:
--------

Note: Engines can be damaged, crippling an already slow ship.

Shield:
-------
Automatic absorbance shield can block most of the incoming damage.
Does not work when/if overloaded by continuous heavy fire.
The shield status indicator is located in the upper-left corner
of the "captain screen"

Note: Shield does cover turrets and engines.


Quirk #1:
---------
Damage (even direct) cut in half (to make this ship really tough
without going over 42 crew (for aesthetic reasons)).

Quirk #2:
---------
"Slow death" (beware of turret fire).
