This ship is made by the rather eccentric Koanua.
They have a much more advanced technology than
their warship would indicate.  Apparetly, they
recognize the need to have warships, but they have
only partially grasped the practical needs of
building combat spacecraft.

fire = delayed thrust missile.  2 power to launch, 4
damage when they hit.  For unknown reasons, the
ship is equipped with a missile release bay, but
not a missile firing tube.  The unguided missile
starts to thrust after it drops free of the ship.

special = ionic turbochager.  Cost is all of the
energy in the battery.  This turns on the ionic
turbocharger in the engine.  The more energy in
the battery when activated, the longer the
turbocharge.  However, thrust is continuous, and
may not be turned off early.  Turning also becomes
worse.  This is meant to allow the ship to escape
from danger.
