Iceci Confusion

This ship is poor in regular combat, but can gain an advantage by firing its special.

Weapon: Short range, low damage, pellet gun, with slight homing capability.

Special: a pair of shots from the sides; when they hit the enemy, it mixes up all controls of the opponent for a few seconds.
