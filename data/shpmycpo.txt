The Mycon Podship is one of the original ships
from Star Control 1.  They were on the Hierarchy side.

They formed an important addition to the UQ fleets,
whom they joined of their free will - accepting that
the UQ were "inevitable". Their help guaranteed UQ
victory over Earth defence forces.

The main consists of a very long range, semi-sentient
homing plasmoid. This weapon loses power slowly with
distance. A full battery is just enough for 2 plasmoids.

The special creates new crew, but this drains the whole
battery.

The Mycon are a fungi like race, living in and on
steaming hot lava worlds. Their "ships" are probably
of organic origin. They can quickly produce new
individuals from spores in a hot radiative environment.
They have a shared memory, which is somewhat incoherent ;)

The Mycon were mostly important for their hostile
relation with the Syreen in star control 2.
