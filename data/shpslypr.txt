The Slylandro Probe is one of the original ships
from Star Control 2.

The main weapon consists of a lightning strike.

The special can be used near asteroids - this destroys
the asteroid and instantly fills up the battery. This
is the only way to refuel.

Robotic automated scouts.

In star control 2 they formed an annoying threat to the
player. The probes could pop up anywhere only to contact
and attack a ship. They were running a program on steroids,
which could lead to a universe dominated by probes, devouring
everything for their reproduction. The geniuses behind
the probes are the Slylandro, a gentle race living in a
gas giant. Otherwise unable to enter space, they'd use the
probes to gather knowledge about their surrounding space.
