The Kohr-Ah Marauder is one of the original
ships from Star Control 2. They are hostiles.

The main consists of blades which can travel
a long way until fire is released. Ideal for
placing one in the line of travel of the enemy.
The blades come with a short-range homing
capability.

The special is named FRIED (fiery ring of 
inevitable and eternal destruction).  It spawns 
a ring of fiery spheres.  If your velocity 
relative to a target is very high you can 
sometimes hit the target with many (3 to 5) 
FRIED shots from a single ring, inflicting 
substancial damage.  If a FRIED shot and an 
enemy projectile collide, the FRIED will always 
win.  This property makes them good for defense.  
Using FRIED consumes half of the maximum battery.  

They resemble black caterpillars.  

The Kohr-Ah are the black offshoot of the 
Ur-Quan race. They were bread by the Dnyarri 
as warriors. The Kohr-Ah philosophy is to 
"cleanse" the universe of anything that shows 
signs of intelligence, on the theory that the 
only viable defense is a preemptive strike.
