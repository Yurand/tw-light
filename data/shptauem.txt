TAU EMP

EMP will jam other ships' controls for a short period of time,
but only the controls/functions currently active. The duration
of the effect decreases with distance from the source.

The tactics is to get close to the enemy and try to disable their
controls, which should allow you to use your guns with less fear
of retaliation.

The best counter tactics is to trick the EMP ship to use its special,
but manage to release all the control keys just before that it does
(you will need keen senses and good reaction to pull it through).
Since EMP use completely drains the battery, your opponent
will not be able to significantly damage or disable you until it
replenishes its battery.
