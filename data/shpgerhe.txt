Idea: GeomanNL.

Ship: Gerl Hero.

Basically, gerls are stupid beings. However, 2 of them can merge together to form a more capable member of their species, a Gerzel. Gerzels can form Gerzelles, Gerzelles even a Gerzellion, but that's beside the point now.

The basic gerl type, I'll call them morons for now, are just able to function as crew of a large spaceship and to keep it's engines and energy dynamo running, which stupidly flies through space following what I'm going to call the hero. The only "intelligent" thing they can do, is avoid the planet - but that is such a conspicuous immobile object, even they can do that.

The hero vessel contains a single Gerzel, who can fearlessly evade missiles, sneak onto an enemy ship, climb onto it, and deal some damage there. When attached to the enemy, he can even influence enemy flight a little by providing its own thrust. Manoeuvering and attack costs fuel though, which the small ship (or should I say, advanced space suit?) cannot produce. When the hero runs out of fuel, he dies. Special makes him leave the enemy ship.

Sitting on the back of a moving ship isn't that comfortable; it takes valuable energy to stay on top, and that is a rather scarce commodity in deep space.

Fortunately there's the moron ship. When the hero is close enough, he can refuel. When you use special, the hero positions himself in front of the ship's nose, after which the morons execute a "launch" command, which launches the hero at very high speeds. Very handy, because that'll save him fuel ;)

Race: see story board.
