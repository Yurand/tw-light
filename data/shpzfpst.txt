The Zoqfotpik Stinger is one of the original ships
from Star Control 2.

Its normal weapon is a short range pellet gun, 
which throws around small projectiles in a wide 
arc.

Its special weapon is a "tongue", able to 
inflict some major damage at VERY short range.  

The Zoq, Fot and Pik are three species who evolved
together with the Zebranky on a single world. They
worked together to destroy the predatory Zebranky,
and form a cooperative society.

They were close to Ur-Quan territory and, though
unnoticed by them, were close to extinction due to
fights between the Kzer-Za and Kohr-Ah taking place
in their systems. They were very eager to get help
against this threat.
