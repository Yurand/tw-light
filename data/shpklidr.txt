The Klisru Dragon is a slow and
relatively sluggish ship.  However, 
the main gun is capable of doing large
amounts of damage to the enemy vessels.

fire - fires the expanding ionic wave
torpedo.  Cost is 4 power.  The weapon
is long ranged, and does 5 damage at
close range.  The weapon slows down as 
it travels, losing damage, but acting
as a navigation hazard.

special - launches a proximity guided
missile.  These will prefer to lock onto
an enemy ship if in range, but will also
intercept incoming weapons fire.
