The Earthling Cruiser is one of the original ships
from Star Control 1.  They were on the Alliance side.
Earthlings, needless to say, are humans.  

The main weapon is very long range nuclear missiles
that home in on enemies.  (surplus MX missiles)

It's special weapon fires point defense lasers at
nearby objects.  (surplus SDI systems)


In Star Control 2, most earthlings were imprisoned on
Earth, but you, the player, were a rogue Earthling in
a spaceship that was an ancient alien artifact 100,000
years old.
