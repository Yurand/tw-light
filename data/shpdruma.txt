The Druuge Mauler is one of the original ships
from Star Control 2.

The Druuge Mauler is essentially a flying long range
cannon. The projectiles it fires have some mass,
which provide backwards momentum for the Druuge and
the enemy ships.

The special is somewhat gruesome - the Druuge throw
their crew into their nuclear furnaces to create
instantaneous battery reserve.

The Druuge are a race living in a dystopian 
corporate society, with an emphasis on trade, 
profit, and cruelty.  

The Druuge trade slaves, fuel and artifacts. They
were responsible for the death of the Gg in order
to save their own skin when the Kohr-Ah approached.
