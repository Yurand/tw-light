Tulkon Ram

Tulkons live on cold planets. They aren't evil just they religion
treat every "warmer" creatures the creations of Satan... or whatever
they name it. Their only natural friends are the Jyglar.

Primary Weapon:
  Pulls the spring of the ramming device in. When the primary weapon button is
  released or when something bumps into the device it is released ramming
  anything it hits. Ramming does damage and accelerates a lot. Tulkon bombs
  are accelerated straight in the direction the ship is facing.

Special:
  Ejects a tulkon bomb. These bombs are sensitive (with range set in tulra.ini
  as Special/SensorRange) to particles eminating from standard fusion thrusters
  (often called hotspots). If they sense heat within range they explode and
  damage objects within damage range (Special/DamageRange). The damage does not
  depend on distance from explosion center.

Notes:
  The ship is mechanically operated so the battery recharge slows down if the
  ship loses crew.
  The ship has non-standard thrusters.
