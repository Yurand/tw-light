Jyglar Starfarer

Primary Weapon:
  Shoots a dense stream of starlike particles. They have random range and damage
  and part of them goes wholly astray. Besides producing random melodies they
  also pull anything that is hit to a point straight before the ship and at
  range/3 distance. It is most effective against light ships.
  
Special:
  Grows ice thorns on its surface. These thorns are easily destroyed but still
  provide protection for the ship.
  The ship has non-standard thrusters.
