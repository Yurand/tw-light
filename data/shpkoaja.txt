Koanua Javelin

This ship is made by the rather eccentric Koanua.
Their first warship was the Koanua Patrol Ship, but
that warship did not seem to command much respect
from opponents.

fire = delayed thrust missile.  3 power to launch, 6
damage when they hit.  They are difficult to use, but
are devastating when they work

special = ionic shotgun.  Cost is 4 power.  This sends
16 random shots forward, for a short distance.  Although
it is a very energy effective weapon, the recycling
time is long.  It is meant to give the ship some
up close attack and defense ability when the delayed
thrust missiles are hard to use.
