Gerbillian Orion:
Adapted from an idea by Baltar.

A very primitive nuclear-driven rocket.

Primary: Fires side-launched rockets.

Special: Releases a thrust-bomb. The large shield on the back protects you from it, but only up to a certain angle (~50 to either side). Just pressing it releases it at a pre-determined distance, but it can be held for longer.

Quirk: Rotational momentum, thrusters on either side turn the ship.

TO DO: 
* Fix the particle effects so they're parted by your shield.
* Add Damage SFX when you take damage from the thrust-bomb
* Fix the side-jets (new art), and on each side
