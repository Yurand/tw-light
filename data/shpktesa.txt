  Fuel-Crew Conversion
  Since the ship's race are a electric based lifeform there battery and crew are
     tied together by:
                   Full batt +1  -> Empty batt & +1 Crew
                   Empty batt -1 -> Full batt & -1 Crew


This ship is good for taking out marine,fighters,DOGI's and the like.  It also take out nukes and plasmoids.  It is best to not get to close to your oppenents because it will reduce effientency of front cannons.  Also ship cannot be hit with defence particle system but they will be hit with the stuff that miss it target, so some ship will get pounded with this, also won't work with lasers.
