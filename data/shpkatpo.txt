Kat Poly

Primary Weapon:
  Fires projectiles from the opening on its back. They fly forwards.
  
Special:
  Morphs into the ship currently targetted (if in natural form) or morphs back to
  natural form (if in alien form).

Notes:
  Only morphing to alien form costs battery. When morphed all statistics of the
  actual form apply but the special ability can not be used (because that key is
  bound to returning to natural form).

  This ship is just an experiment, not intended to be included in the full game.
