Melee:  Starts a battle.  In battle the following keys do stuff:
        F1 brings up the help screen (this file, at the moment)
        F2 brings up the options menu
        F3 switches camera focus
        F4 is fast-forward (speeds up in-game time greatly)
        F5 displays fleet status
        F7 changes game tic rate (physics quality)
        F8 changes camera mode
        F9 creates planets (silly "feature")
        F10 quits (so does ESCAPE)
        F11 saves screenshots
        F12 displays framerates / performance data
        - zooms out on some viewing modes.
        + (or =) zooms in on some viewing modes.
        0 and 9 also effect the camera in some viewing modes.
        ctrl+T = toggle team indicators on/off
        ctrl+H = toggle healthbar indicators on/off
        Also, if some controllers are set to keyboard, customizable
        buttons may cause ship actions.  Be default these are:
        Config 0:
                left:   Keypad 4
                thrust: Keypad 8
                right:  Keypad 6
                fire:   Enter
                special:Space
                next:   Closebrace (])
                prev:   Openbrace ([)
                near:   P
        Config 1:
                left:   A
                thrust: S
                right:  D
                fire:   B
                special:V
                next:   F
                prev:   G
                near:   H

                This returns to the main menu.
		
Teams:
        Select Controller:
              Select the player (i.e. "Player 1" or "Player 2")
              you wish to alter from the list on the left, and
              the controller (i.e. "Keyboard", "MoronBot") you
              want to control that player from the list on the
              left.  Then either click on the "Select
              Controller" button or double click on the
              controller name.
	Change Team #: 
	      This switches the player allys. 
	      Note that team 0 mean no allys.
        Change Config #:
               This switches the configuration used by the
               currently highlighted controller.  
        Edit Configuration:
               This is used to setup up keys when the currently
               highlighted player is using the keyboard.  It
               may eventually allow the configuration of AIs
               and calibration of joysticks.
        Edit Fleet:
               This button brings up the fleet selection menu for
               the currently highlighted player.  
        Main Menu:
                 This returns to the main menu.
Options:
        Most things on this menu are self-explanatory, but a few
          need special mention.

        Gamma correction:
                This makes things brighter during combat.  This
                should not be changed from the middle of combat,
                or colors could get weird.  
        Antialiasing:
                If this box is checked then TimeWarp will use
                higher quality graphics, but run slower.  
        Color Depth:
                You cannot change this from the middle of combat.  
        Camera Mode:
                This allows you to control what is shown on your
                screen in combat.  

                "Enemy_Discrete"
                  is just like Star Control on the PC, where
                  the camera moved to keep both you and your
                  enemy onscreen, and zoomed in by factors of
                  2.
                "Enemy"
                  is like Star Control on the Genesis or 3DO,
                  where the camera zoomed in smoothly.
                "Hero"
                  makes the camera stay focused on Player 1,
                  and zoom in/out when + and - are pressed.
                "Everything"
                  makes the camera stay on the planet and zoom
                  way out so that everything is visible.  This
                  mode is slightly buggy (visual artifacts).
		"Dynamic"
		  is like Enemy but track nearest enemy
