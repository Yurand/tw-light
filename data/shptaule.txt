*Tau* LEVIATHAN V.3.1
---------------------

Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 2 seemed a bit overcomplicated, so back we go to
the simplicity of v.1. The only differences include size (smaller),
power (weaker), and textures (prettier?)

Weapon:
~~~~~~~
"Corrosive gas" or whatever. On impact, produces "food"
proportional to the enemy crew killed. By picking up "food"
the ship is able to regenerate "health" and recharge battery
("normal" recharge rate is slow, so make sure you spend battery
wisely and pick up all the "food" you can)

Special:
~~~~~~~~
Biomechanical missile. Long range, homing, minimal damage.
However, the missile is able to override target's engine systems,
for a short while disabling turning and slowing the ship down.
