The Dyzun Harbringer is a mid-sized ship
that was designed to go hunt down larger
vessels and kill them.

pressing the fire button activates one
of the pair of plasma cannons mounted on 
each side of the ship.  Although they are
quite short ranged, they can quickly rip
an opponent to shreds.

pressing the special button launches
a pair of long range missiles.  Each
missile has a massive warhead (4 pts
of damage!) but the missiles are slow
and do not track quickly.  They are used
to kill slow moving, large ships and to
restrict the maneuvering of fast
opponents.
