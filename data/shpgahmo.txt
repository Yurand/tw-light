Gahmur Monitor

This is a behemoth-class ship which uses
homing plasma projectile as the primary armament.

fire:  Holding down the fire button charges up
the plasma launcher.  Plasma projectiles may be
damaged in a way similar to mycon torpedoes, but
are more resistant to damage.  The plasma projectiles
lose power as they travel further from the point of
launch.  While charging, the dynamo does not recharge
the battery.

release fire:  releasing the fire button launches
a charged plasma projectile.  Anywhere from
one to forty points of power may be in the
projectile.  The charging curve is non-linear:
1 power : damage 3, range 15, speed 15.
20 power: damage 9, range 50, speed 35.
40 power: damage 16, range 85, speed 55.

The plasma projectile automatically is facing the target.
These cannot injure the firing ship.

fire + special:  Only has an effect if the fire
button has been held down and the plasma launcher
has been charged up.  This uses the current
energy in the launcher to fire a beam of coherent
plasma straight ahead from both launchers.
The damage and effect is non-linear:

1 power: 2 beams, damage 1 each, range 5
20 power: 2 beams, damage 4 each, range 25
40 power: 2 beams, damage 8 each, range 45

special:  Pushing and releasing the special
(without the fire button) toggles the tractor
beam on and off.  Activating the tractor
beam stops the dynamo, costs 4 power, and
continues to cost 4 power per second.
The beam slowly extends in front of the ship.
When the tractor beam hits an object with
mass, it holds the two units together, although
not perfectly.

Holding a target in a tractor beam only costs
1 power per second.  Also, 1 point of direct
damage is done every second to a target caught
in the tractor beam.
