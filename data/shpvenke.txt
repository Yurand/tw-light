The Ven-Kek frigate is a large, fast, maneuverable
ship.  The propulsion system is a unique vectored
ion engine, that allows for rapid forward motion
and rapid turning.  The downside is that when
the ship tries to turn and accelerate at the same time,
the engine has reduced effect at doing both at once.

The direct exhaust of the propulsion system is capable of
damaing other vessels, although this is a difficult
maneuver to pull off.  The exhaust also ejects numerous
still burning sparks of fuel, which are also damaging
to other units. 


Fire - this fires the forward proton bolt cannons.
Most of the ship's mass is used for propulsion, so the
weapon is shorter range and less powerful than others
of its size.  Energy cost is 1, damage is 1.

Special - this activates the afterburner on the ship
for one second, for a cost of 6 energy.  Acceleration
and max speed are increased, and the exhaust
grows in size and becomes easier to use as a weapon.
however, when the afterburner is active, the ship may
not stop thrusting forward.
