EARTHLING CRUISER MK2  (code name "Crusader") v.1.4

New technological advances and reverse engineering of some of the Precursors' technology
made possible the construction of this ship. It is faster, with higher energy capacity and regeneration.
Its weapon is a replica of the Fusion Blasters (a bit less powerfull than its Precursor analogue though)
with ATS. Point Defense Laser now fires twice as fast.

Unfortunately, with all that machinery there was just not enough space abroad, so crew capacity had
to be decreased (not significantly, though). And, to improve maximum speed and acceleration, some of
the maneuverability (for which Cruiser is known) had to be sacrificed in order to accommodate more thrusters.

Note 1: Be very careful with the new PDL - it can deplete your battery in a glimpse.

Note 2: Mk2's ATS is somewhat inferior to its Precursor's analogue, and cannot efficiently work at short range.
So don't rely too much on homing in close-up combat; fire from medium and long range to utilize your ATS to
its full capacity.
