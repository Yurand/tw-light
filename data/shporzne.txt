The Orz Nemesis is one of the original ships
from Star Control 2.

The main weapon consists of a gun turret with 
mediumrange.

Special allows you to rotate the turret, which is
not that useful a feature, but looks nice.  You 
do this by holding down special and pressing the 
turn buttons.  

The second special launches Orz space marines,
which can use a planet's gravity field to achieve
high velocities and board the enemy; once on board,
they can kill a random amount of crew. They can
stay in space indefinitely, but return when the
target is destroyed.  To launch marines, press 
both the special key and the fire key at the same 
time.  

The Orz are a fish-like creatures, who need the
safe environment of a space suit to walk around
in space.

The Orz come from an alien dimension they call
*below*. They've a suspicious connection to the
disappearance of the Androsynths. Though the
story implies that they could pose a big threat,
they're friendly and of minor importance in the game.

The Orz are an strange race, with childish sillyness 
and simplicity, an undercurrent of a Lovecraftian 
horror theme, and an overall very friendly attitude.  
It's implied in SC2 that you should be afraid of them, 
but for practical purposes allying with them is easy, 
useful, and harmless.  The Arilou seem to particularly 
dislike the Orz.
