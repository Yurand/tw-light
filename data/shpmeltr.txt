The Melnorme Trader is one of the original ships
from Star Control 2; neutrals.

The main consists of a light sphere. This can be
charged to do more damage upon release. When fully
charged, the weapon sphere can absorb enemy fire
and act as a small shield.

Special fires some field with long range, which on
impact puts the enemy into an uncontrollable spin,
disabling the rotation controls.  This field 
can pass right through most defenses.  

The Melnorme are cyclopses.  

The Melnorme are neutral traders, apparently without
a homeworld. They provide a wealth of information
and technology in exchange for data on lifeforms.
Their origins are a mystery, they could be
descendants of the Mael-Num, a Milieu race.
