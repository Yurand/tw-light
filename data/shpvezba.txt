Vezlagari Battle Barge.

This ship is a converted freighter.  The vezlagari
are very defense-minded, and they augmented their
freighters with a massive armour plate/energy 
defense grid welded to the front of the freighter.
However, in this design, there were no openings for
weapon ports.  Therefore, the two missile tubes point
backwards, and the missiles turn around quickly
and race towards the enemy.

The armour can take a vicious pounding, but it
does not make the ship invulnerable to damage.
A determined frontal assault will, over time,
break down the armour/shielding.

fire - launch two unguided corkscrew missiles.
The vezlagari have not worked all of the kinks
out of the guidance system, so the missiles
tend to wander.  Damage is 2, energy is 2.

special - send energy to the armor plate/defense
grid.  This costs 12 (all) energy, and undoes the
effect of 3 points of damage.

Other - the front armour has a rebound effect.  If a 
solid object strikes the front armour, the ship
and the other object will recoil away from each other.
This is automatic.
