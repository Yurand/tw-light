The Chmmr Avatar is one of the original ships
from Star Control 2.

The ship's main weapon consists of an uberlaser.

Three defense satellites circle the ship. Each is
equipped with a short-range auto-targeting laser.

The special is a tractor beam with unlimited range.

The Chmmr are a race born of two races, the Chenjesu 
and the Mrmnmhrm, in an attempt to save the latter from 
extinction.  The Chmmr are immensely powerful, hyper-
intelligent, and possibly somewhat schizophenic.  

The Chmmr were slave-shielded by the Ur-Quan, but 
when set free provided a valuable contribution to
the fight for freedom.
