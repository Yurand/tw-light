Imperial Katana

Primary Weapon:
  The ship has a laser blade mounted on its front.
  Pressing the primary weapon key heats it up, without it the blade cools down.
  The higher the heat, the more damage it does (no damage without enough heat).
  If the heat goes too high the ship blows up. (The heat is indicated in place
  of the battery.)
  If the heat is above a value (set in impka.ini as Weapon/RadHeat) radioactivity
  starts to build up (speed set in impka.ini as Weapon/RadBuildup). The process
  is irreversible. When fully built up (as seen on the captain panel) a halo
  appears around the ship and it is now radioactive.
  
Special:
  Releases radioactivity in form of a gas cloud. The cloud is highly explosive,
  so the ship needs to be fully cooled down to safely use this ability.

Notes:
  If a ship is radioactive it loses crew over time (as set in impka.ini Special
  section). Most ships can not get rid of radioactivity and will slowly die.
  The halo around a radioactive ship infects any other ship on contact.
  If a radioactive ship (either the Katana or another) is destroyed the
  radioactivity is released once again.
