The Ilwrath Avenger is one of the original ships
from Star Control 1.  They were on the Hierarchy side.

The Avengers main weapon spouts short range hellfire
in front of the ship.

Its special weapon turns the ship invisible.  If it
fires while invisible it becomes visible and instantly
aims towards the enemy ship.  

Discrepancy: cloaking in TimeWarp is much more powerfull
than in SC1/2 because the camera position does not
reveal their position.  

Ilwrath look like spiders.  In SC1 they have 5 legs, in
SC2 8 legs.  

In Star Control 2, Ilwrath are depicted as the ultimate
in villany and cruelty, but not very powerfull.
