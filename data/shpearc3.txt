EARTHLING CRUISER MK3

This ship represents yet another attempt to make a worthy "new generation" Earthling ship.
Started a along time ago, it would never be competed if it was not for Starwreck, which
inspired that last effort needed to bring this ship to life.  And, sure enough, this attempt
brings the Earthling Cruiser a step or two closer to its 'Treck predecessors (which is not
necessarily a bad thing).

Primary weapon on this ship is the proton torpedo launcher, capable of firing highly destructive
projectiles at long range.  Advanced targeting system automatically tracks all major targets in range
and calculates optimum firing angle.  However, the launcher itself is limited to a relatively small
firing arc, and can take some time to aim in on target.  The limited accuracy is an inherited problem
of all existing proton torpedo launchers.

Secondary weapon system is the short-range point defense laser (PDL).  The beam can be fired
in short bursts, with some time required to cool down the emitter.   Each burst is automatically
aimed at the nearest non-friendly object.  If the object is destroyed or is out of range, PDL can
quickly acquire a new target.  This weapon is especially effective against projectile weapons.
