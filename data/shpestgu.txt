Estion Gunner

Primary Weapon:
  Huge blue projectiles that bounce off of any target. If a Platform is
  nearby the shots bounce towards it.
  
Special:
  Launches Platforms that stop after a small amount of time. Platforms shoot
  the Gunner's own projectiles towards the targetted vessel. The projectiles
  regain range this way. If this range is not enough to reach the target the
  projectiles are shot towards the next Platform nearby the target (if there
  is any). Only a limited number of Platforms can be active.
