Cracks Planetoid

The Cracks are a rocklike race. Their home system has no planets, only space debris, caused by a cataclismic war almost a billion year ago. They live on planetoids with which they can explore deep space.


Main weapon: crushes asteroids and sends glowing remains into space.

Special weapon: refits an asteroid with a (homing) engine and an integrity shield, letting it have 6 armour and on impact it'll do 2 damage.

Due to its asymmetrical shape, the planetoid can turn easiest clockwise.


Names are like:

Crush
Crumble
Shatter
Break
