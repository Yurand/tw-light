Neogg DrainMain weapon: small missile, short range and 1 damage.Special: laser, medium range, drains enemy energy. Use of this weapon does not cost you energy, but it has the nasty side-effect of doubling the main weapon's energy usage.Note:based on idea of Neo B.It's an Utwig killer, but due to its limited crew complement, don't come close to the Utwig.
