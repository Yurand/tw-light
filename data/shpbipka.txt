Bipole Katamaran

For a stone-like race. Maybe Taalo...

Primary Weapon:
  Both sideships have a simple projectile cannon.
  
Special:
  Increases the distance between the sideships (if both exist) or accelerates
  backwards (if only one of them exists).

Notes:
  This ship is made up of two 'sideships' each of which can survive the
  destruction of the other. Their crew and battery is kept track of independently
  but is shown on the panel summed.
