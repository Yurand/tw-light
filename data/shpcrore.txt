1. Weapon - press and hold. The longer you hold, the further the shot will go before exploding (same damage).
There's a maximum range (and maximums "charge" time, after whihc the shot is fire d automatically).
The areas effect DOES affect the ship itself (though as if it was at double the distance), so be careful.

2. Special - repulsion filed. No comment.
