User's Manual:

Here's a few tips that should help you get a grip on piloting this utterly unbalanced and completely "unSC-ish" ship.

1. Engine.

In addition to a standard inertia-less drive this ship is equipped with a turbo ram-scoop booster.
The booster is most effective when traveling at high speed, facing in the direction of movement.
An unfortunate side effect is that if you activate the engine while facing significantly off the
direction of movement, you will slow down your ship. Getting up to speed again will take precious time,
so the best tactics is to keep going non-stop (be careful and avoid collisions and sharp turns).

2. Weapon.

Nothing out-of-the-ordinary here - just a couple of heat-seeking missiles.

3. Shield.

This ship is equipped with Mark VIII damper shield, which can absorb practically *any* damage.
The shield activates automatically, provided there is enough energy in the ship's battery reserve.
While active, shield is constantly draining small amount of energy, so make sure you deactivate it
when it is no longer needed (press "special" function key to deactivate the shield). Keep in mind,
however, that activating the shield again might take more energy than keeping it up for a while.

Note:

Neither weapons nor turbo booster can operate while the shield is up
(the basic inertia-less dirve can still be somewhat useful though).
