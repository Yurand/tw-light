The Ur-Quan Dreadnought is one of the original ships
from Star Control 1.  They were on the Hierarchy side.
In fact, they were the founders and masters of the
Urquan Hierarchy (i.e. the main badguy).  In Star
Control 2, their name was changed to the Ur-Quan
Kzer-Za, sometimes called green Urquan, to distinguish
them from the black urquan, the Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah.  

The Dreadnoughts main weapon fires fusion blasts.  It
fires fairly quickly, does a lot of damage, and has a
decent range.  

The Dreadnoughts special weapon launches 2 fighter ships
which seek out enemies and kill them.  These fighters can
do enourmous damage, but launching them costs crew, which
is regained when the fighter returns.  

Urquan are green catepillar-like creatures.

In Star Control 2, the Urquan are the guys who imprisoned
everyone under force shields, so they seem like the badguy.
But they are much more complex than that.  Urquan are
mighty, proud, arrogant, kind, masochistic, and ultimately
tragic.  The Urquan overcame their predatory nature long ago
to be a part of a mutually beneficial galactic society, but
a horrific struggle 20,000 years ago destroyed galactic
civilization and permanently warped the urquans view of the
universe.  Now they go around enslaving and imprisoning other
races, with the best of intentions.  Parts of their history are
reminiscient of the writtings of science fiction author Larry
Niven.
