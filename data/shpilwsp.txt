Ilwrath Spider

During the war against the Traddash the Ilwrath could salvage some Traddash
technology and came out with this new prototype. (non-official concept)

Primary Weapon:
  Improved dual version of the original flamethrowers partially based on the Torch's
  after burners.
  
Special:
  Strange smoke that stops everything for a small amount of time. Even projectiles.
  The smoke completly adsorbs laser.
