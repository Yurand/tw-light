The velron cruiser is a fast ship with a deadly main weapon.
There was a trade-off to achieve this, however.  The power
for the main weapon is drawn from the fusion engine that propels
the ship.  When the battery is depleted, the engine turns off
until enough battery energy is stored to re-ignite the engine.
The maneuvering thrusters are also reduced during the battery recharge,
but to a lesser extent.

fire = massive short range bolt (10 damage, 20 range, 10 energy to launch),
using this causes an engine flame-out until the battery refills.

special = seven lasers project outward from the ship at various angles.  The
energy cost is a mere 1 as the lasers have an independent power source.  This
system was installed to give the cruiser some defensive capability when the
fusion engine was drained.
