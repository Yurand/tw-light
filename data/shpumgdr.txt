The Umgah Drone is one of the original ships
from Star Control 1.  They were on the Alliance side.

The Umgah were battle thralls of the Ur-Quan.

The main is a powerful antimatter cone, having very
short range, but being able to rapidly inflict damage
to objects entering it. It forms an almost impenetrable
forward-facing shield.

The special allows the Drone to fly rapidly
backwards. Very useful to intercept enemies.

The Umgah are a self-bio-engineered race of creeps.

In star control 2, the Umgah are the pranksters
of space, playing dirty tricks on races for laughs.
They were responsible for reviving a Dnyarri, using
their superior bi-engineering skills.
