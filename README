About
=====

TW-Light is fork of TimeWarp. It includes only a combat portion
of TimeWarp. Main goal of this fork is stable melee engine
for implementing adventure game.

Usage
=====

Melee
-----

Starts a battle.  In battle the following keys do stuff::

  * F1 brings up the help screen (this file, at the moment)
  * F2 brings up the options menu
  * F3 switches camera focus
  * F4 is fast-forward (speeds up in-game time greatly)
  * F5 displays fleet status
  * F7 changes game tic rate (physics quality)
  * F8 changes camera mode
  * F9 creates planets (silly "feature")
  * F10 quits (so does ESCAPE)
  * F11 saves screenshots
  * F12 displays framerates / performance data
  * - zooms out on some viewing modes.
  * + (or =) zooms in on some viewing modes.
  * 0 and 9 also effect the camera in some viewing modes.
  * ctrl+T = toggle team indicators on/off
  * ctrl+H = toggle healthbar indicators on/off

If some controllers are set to keyboard, customizable buttons may cause ship actions.
Be default these are::

  Config 0:

    left:   Keypad 4
    thrust: Keypad 8
    right:  Keypad 6
    fire:   Enter
    special:Space
    next:   Closebrace (])
    prev:   Openbrace ([)
    near:   P

Options
-------

Most things on this menu are self-explanatory, but a few need special mention.

Gamma correction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This makes things brighter during combat.  This should not be changed from
the middle of combat, or colors could get weird.

Antialiasing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If this box is checked then TimeWarp will use higher quality graphics, but
run slower.

Color Depth
^^^^^^^^^^^

You cannot change this from the middle of combat.

Camera Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^

This allows you to control what is shown on your screen in combat.


"Enemy_Discrete" is just st like Star Control on the PC, where the camera
moved to keep both you and your enemy onscreen, and zoomed in by factors of 2.

"Enemy" is like Star Control on the Genesis or 3DO, where the camera zoomed in smoothly.

"Hero" makes the camera stay focused on Player 1, and zoom in/out when + and -
are pressed.

"Everything" makes the camera stay on the planet and zoom way out so that everything is visible.
This mode is slightly buggy (visual artifacts).
